# Reflection - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Reflection is the **process** that transforms experiences into memory. It's not storage - it's the distillation pipeline that runs at strategic moments to extract insights from stmemory into ltmemory.

```
Experience → stmemory
                │
                ▼ (reflection invoked)
         ┌──────────────┐
         │ Acquisitive  │ → what's new/worth capturing?
         │ Episodic     │ → what happened?
         │ Integrative  │ → how does it connect?
         │ Retentive    │ → what to keep?
         └──────────────┘
                │
                ▼ (distillation)
            ltmemory
```

## Problem Statement

Without reflection, agents either:
- Store everything (bloated, noisy ltmemory)
- Store nothing (no learning)
- Require manual curation of what to remember

Reflection automates the "thinking about what happened" process that humans do naturally.

## Solution

Implement a Reflection process with four phases:

| Phase | Question | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Acquisitive | What's new or worth capturing? | Candidate memories |
| Episodic | What happened? (narrative) | Episode summaries |
| Integrative | How does this connect to existing knowledge? | Patterns, links |
| Retentive | What should be kept long-term? | Filtered memories → ltmemory |

## When Reflection Runs

Reflection is invoked at **strategic moments**, not continuously:

| Trigger | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Session end | Natural boundary, time to consolidate |
| Task completion | Milestone achieved, lessons to capture |
| Explicit request | User/agent says "reflect on this" |
| Threshold reached | stmemory size exceeds limit |
| Scheduled | Periodic (e.g., daily) consolidation |

## User Stories

1. **As an agent**, I want to automatically extract lessons from completed tasks so I improve over time.

2. **As an agent**, I want to consolidate session history into durable memories so I don't lose insights.

3. **As a developer**, I want to trigger reflection at appropriate moments so the agent learns efficiently.

4. **As a user**, I want the agent to remember important things without remembering everything.

## Phases Explained

### Acquisitive
Scans stmemory for noteworthy content:
- New information learned
- Corrections received
- User preferences expressed
- Unexpected outcomes

### Episodic
Captures what happened as narrative:
- Task attempted and outcome
- Key steps taken
- Obstacles encountered
- Decisions made

### Integrative
Connects new experience to existing knowledge:
- Similar past experiences
- Patterns emerging
- Contradictions to resolve
- Knowledge to update

### Retentive
Filters what actually gets stored:
- Is this worth remembering?
- Is it already known?
- How important is it?
- What's the minimal form?

## Requirements

### Functional
- Accept stmemory as input
- Accept ltmemory for integration queries
- Run four phases in sequence
- Output structured memories for ltmemory storage
- Return reflection summary

### Non-Functional
- Use LLM for each phase (semantic understanding required)
- Configurable phase prompts
- Total reflection time < 30s for typical session
- Idempotent (re-running doesn't duplicate memories)

### Codec Independence

Reflection's LLM calls are **independent of the STARAgent codec system**. The codec system (CSXMLCodec, CodecToolCaller, LocalPromptAPI) is used for agent-user interaction and tool calling. Reflection's internal phases are simple LLM queries that don't require tool calling or structured response formats.

| Component | Uses Codec? | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| STARAgent (tool calling) | ✅ Yes | Needs structured parsing for tool invocations |
| Reflection (4 phases) | ❌ No | Simple text prompts, no tool calling |
| RLM queries | ❌ No | Python sandbox execution, not LLM tool calling |

## Success Metrics

1. **Signal-to-noise**: ltmemory contains useful, not redundant memories
2. **Coverage**: Important lessons captured, not missed
3. **Integration**: New memories connect to existing knowledge

## Scope

### In MVP
- All four phases implemented
- LLM-based phase execution
- stmemory → ltmemory pipeline
- Manual trigger (explicit call)
- Basic prompts for each phase

### Out of MVP (Future)
- Automatic triggers (session end, threshold)
- Importance scoring
- Duplicate detection
- Memory consolidation (merging related memories)
- Phase customization per agent type

## STARAgent Integration

### Current State: Learner Component

STARAgent already has a `Learner` component (`dana.core.agent.components.learner`) that implements the four reflection phases:

| Aspect | Learner (Current) | Reflection (Spec) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **4 Phases** | ✅ Has all 4 | ✅ Specifies all 4 |
| **LLM-based** | ✅ DefaultLearner uses LLM | ✅ Required |
| **stmemory input** | ⚠️ Uses Timeline | ✅ Uses STMemory |
| **ltmemory output** | ✅ Persists to LTMemory | ✅ Persists to LTMemory |
| **ltmemory query** | ✅ Queries in RETENTIVE | ✅ Queries in Integrative |
| **Standalone** | ✅ Reflection class exists | ✅ Standalone class |

### Integration Approach

**Option A: Enhance Learner** (Recommended)
- Add LTMemory persistence to Learner's retentive phase
- Add LTMemory query to Learner's integrative phase
- Keep Learner as STARAgent's interface to reflection

**Option B: Replace Learner with Reflection**
- Create standalone Reflection class per spec
- Learner becomes thin wrapper calling Reflection
- More modular but more refactoring

### Key Integration Requirements

1. **Learner must persist to LTMemory**
   ```python
   def _reflect_retentive(self, trace_retentive):
       memories = self._extract_memories(trace_retentive)
       if self._agent._ltmemory:
           for memory in memories:
               self._agent._ltmemory.store(memory)
   ```

2. **Learner must query LTMemory in integrative phase**
   ```python
   def _reflect_integrative(self, trace_integrative):
       existing = ""
       if self._agent._ltmemory:
           existing = self._agent._ltmemory.query("relevant past experiences")
       # Include existing in integration analysis
   ```

3. **Reflection triggers**
   - Session end: `agent.end_session()` triggers reflection
   - Explicit: `agent.reflect()` method
   - Threshold: When stmemory/timeline exceeds size

## Demo

When Reflection MVP is complete, we can demonstrate:

```python
from dana.core.memory import STMemory, LTMemory
from dana.core.reflection import Reflection

# Session with some experiences
stmem = STMemory()
stmem.append("user", "How do I fix the N+1 query?")
stmem.append("agent", "Found the issue in user_loader.py")
stmem.append("observation", "Added .prefetch_related(), 10x speedup")
stmem.append("user", "That worked, thanks!")

# Long-term memory (may have existing knowledge)
ltmem = LTMemory(path="./memories/")

# Run reflection
reflection = Reflection(llm_model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
result = reflection.run(stmemory=stmem, ltmemory=ltmem)

print(result.summary)
# → "Session involved fixing N+1 query. Key lesson captured."

print(result.memories_created)
# → [
#     {type: "lesson", content: "N+1 queries fixed with prefetch_related()"},
#     {type: "episode", content: "Helped user optimize database query..."}
#   ]

# Memories automatically stored in ltmemory
print(ltmem.count())  # Now has new memories
```

**Demo narrative**: "Agent reflects on session, extracts lessons and episodes, stores to long-term memory. Next session, it can recall these."
